An open-source, community-driven library of prompts and instruction files for AI-assisted software development. Designed to be **human-readable** for review and **machine-readable** for ingestion by MCP servers, AI agents, and automation tooling.

## Vision

Building software with AI should be **accurate, secure, cost-effective, performant, and trustworthy**. This catalog provides structured prompts and guardrail instructions that help AI agents stay on track across every phase of the software development lifecycle — from requirements gathering through production operations.

## Who Is This For?

| Audience | How They Use It |
|----------|----------------|
| **Non-technical SMEs** | Use planning and requirements prompts to communicate ideas clearly to AI agents |
| **Junior Developers** | Follow guided prompts for implementation, testing, and learning best practices |
| **Senior Developers** | Leverage architecture, optimization, and domain-specific prompts |
| **Architects** | Use system design, cloud architecture, and compliance prompts |
| **DevOps / SRE** | Use deployment, monitoring, and operations prompts |
| **AI Agent Authors** | Ingest prompts and instructions via MCP server integration |

## Prompt Format

All prompts use **YAML** for human readability with a consistent schema that supports machine parsing. Each prompt includes:

```yaml
id: "PLAN-REQ-001"
version: "1.0.0"
title: "Gather Functional Requirements"
description: "Guides an AI agent through structured requirements elicitation"
category: "planning"
subcategory: "requirements"
skill_level: "beginner"           # beginner | intermediate | advanced | expert
platforms: ["all"]
tags: ["requirements", "planning", "stakeholder"]
author: "community"
last_reviewed: "2026-02-12"

prompt: |
  The actual prompt text goes here...

variables:
  - name: "project_type"
    description: "Type of software project"
    required: true
    examples: ["web-app", "mobile-app", "api-service"]

expected_output: "Structured requirements document"
quality_criteria:
  - "All functional areas covered"
  - "Acceptance criteria defined for each requirement"
```

## Instruction Files

Instruction files are Markdown documents designed to be loaded as system-level context for AI agents. They provide guardrails across:

- **SDLC Phases** — Keep agents focused on the current development phase
- **Guardrails** — Enforce accuracy, security, cost, performance, and anti-hallucination practices
- **Platforms** — Platform-specific conventions, APIs, and pitfalls

## MCP Server Integration

The catalog ships with a working [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server. Install it once and every MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, etc.) can access all prompts and instructions as first-class resources.

```bash
# Install
cd server && pip install -e .

# Start the server
prompt-catalog serve
```

See [server/README.md](server/README.md) for Claude Desktop and VS Code configuration.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start with the CLI

The fastest way to get started is the interactive CLI:

```bash
# Install the CLI
cd server && pip install -e .

# Interactive guided mode — recommends prompts based on your project
prompt-catalog start

# List all prompts
prompt-catalog list

# Search by keyword
prompt-catalog search "authentication"

# View a specific prompt
prompt-catalog show SEC-THREAT-001

# List starter kits
prompt-catalog kit list

# Export a kit's prompts and instructions to your project
prompt-catalog kit export saas-web-app --output ./my-project/.prompts
```

### Use a Starter Kit

Don't know where to start? Pick a [starter kit](starter-kits/):

| Kit | Best For |
|-----|----------|
| `saas-web-app` | Next.js, Rails, Django SaaS products |
| `api-backend` | REST/GraphQL API services |
| `mobile-app` | iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native |
| `cloud-native` | Kubernetes, microservices, serverless |
| `fintech-platform` | Banking, payments, trading (with compliance) |
| `healthcare-app` | HIPAA, HL7 FHIR, clinical applications |

### MCP Server Integration

Serve the entire catalog as an MCP server for Claude Desktop, VS Code, or any MCP-compatible client:

```bash
prompt-catalog serve
```

See [server/README.md](server/README.md) for configuration details.

### Follow the Tutorial

New to the catalog? Start here:

> **[Build a SaaS Task Manager from Zero](tutorials/build-saas-from-zero.md)** — A complete walkthrough of building a team task management app using the `saas-web-app` starter kit. Shows every prompt, every variable fill-in, and what the prompts catch that you'd otherwise miss.

### Browse Prompts
Navigate the `prompts/` directory organized by SDLC phase, or use the master `prompts/index.json` to search programmatically.

### Use Manually
1. Find a relevant prompt in `prompts/`
2. Fill in the `variables` with your project specifics
3. Paste into your AI assistant of choice

### Learn from Case Studies

See how the catalog applies to real open-source projects in [case-studies/](case-studies/):
- **Sentry** — Error tracking platform (microservices, multi-tenancy, observability)
- **Medplum** — Healthcare infrastructure (HIPAA, FHIR, PHI)
- **Maybe** — Personal finance app (decimal arithmetic, reconciliation)
- **Cal.com** — Scheduling SaaS (timezone handling, OAuth, race conditions)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on:

- Adding new prompts
- Improving existing prompts
- Adding domain coverage
- Reviewing and testing prompts
- Translating prompts

## Principles

1. **Accuracy over speed** — Prompts should guide AI to verify before asserting
2. **Security by default** — Security is not optional; it's embedded in every phase
3. **Cost-awareness** — Both in AI token usage and in the software being built
4. **Performance-conscious** — Prompts should guide toward performant solutions
5. **Anti-hallucination** — Explicit instructions to cite sources, admit uncertainty, and verify
6. **Adversarial evaluation** — Every output is stress-tested with hostile inputs, judged against rubrics, and red-teamed
7. **Trust through transparency** — Every prompt is reviewable, versioned, and testable
8. **Progressive complexity** — Support users from beginner to expert
9. **Platform-agnostic where possible** — Abstract patterns, specific implementations
